JToDo - A Java To-Do List (Backend-alt)
------------------------------

### Overview

This is the backend of [JToDo](https://github.com/MossTheFox/coursework-jtodo) - a Java To-Do List App created for coursework only.

This version of server works with MySQL. The MongoDB version is [here](https://github.com/MossTheFox/coursework-jtodo-server).

Notice that all the database connection URLs in the ```.env``` file needs to be changed if you are going to host it on your own server.

Also, notice that the user authentication process shares some backend service with [app.mxowl.com](https://app.mxowl.com/) whose backend is using mongoDB and is not open source for security reasons. You may need to implement your own authentication process.
